## SOLO LEARN – LEARN TO CODE



As the name goes, it is a self-learning application which can be used to gain ample knowledge on how to code, how efficiently it can be done and which coding language to use. It offers more than a dozen coding languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, C, C++, Java, C#, Swift, Python, Kotlin, SQL and many more. It is one of the simple, most efficient and best e-learning platforms compared to other applications. I have made use of this application for learning coding languages that were out of my curriculum. It also has an inbuilt forum for user-generated code examples and Q&A centre for raising our queries. It has many challenging questions between the course content to test and practice the course we learnt. There is a separate code playground where we can test our own code in any of the available coding languages. The activity feed keeps us updated on daily challenges and weekly highlights.

Solo learn is a freeware knowledge repository. Anyone can use it on the go to gain coding knowledge. It has an elegant user interface which has a game like features with user account, level upgrades and badges for each level. This marketing strategy helps the application to retain its top spot among the mobile application users. Users will get timely notifications on new course addition, course progress and much more on forum questions. We can challenge other users in the play arena on our strengths. The course materials are integrated through cloud which can be accessed through the app as well as the web version of solo learn. There is a user progress tracking mechanism used for measuring their performances on each course they choose.

Solo learn delivers more than expected number of coding examples with a user-friendly interface and courses for absolutely no cost, which is an asset. We can create our own community with nearby or facebook friends and host coding challenges among friends. It has an in-house code editor which supports plenty of languages. When we are stuck with some questions, instant help is provided as hints after 3 wrong attempts or we can make use of the user community forum for a detailed explanation of the given problem. There are few unwanted ads in between chapters. It does not train someone to a pro level coding with the course materials, we must make use of coding playground for more extensive practice. I would like to suggest some enhancements in course content by delivering users with few levels of difficulty (like easy, intermediate, pro, expert). There can be video tutorials by some expert coder from an organisation once a week or so. FAQ’s can be added as a part of offering help to the users to solve simple issues in the app.


## **BLITTER – THE BILL SPLITTER**

Blitter is an android application is a simple finance application that inputs the bills and helps in splitting it in required proportion among friends. As the world is completely transforming towards digital currencies, the usage of cards, NFC pay has increased subsequently. While sharing a room with friends, it is not an easy task to track all the expenses manually. This tool helps to keep track of all my expenses and contributions on a shared expenditure. I picked this application over other bill organizer and splitter apps are because of its simple user interface and easy to use features.

This tool helps me in day to day life in splitting my bill with my roommates while going to a restaurant or for a grocery shopping just with the use of bill receipt in seconds. Since it is a free application with a bunch of exciting features, it gathers user attention for its automatic bill entry feature. Users can also write the bill details manually, but I prefer using the bill capture method. Bills can be scanned using the camera, which is immediately recognized and converted into a bill like format for crosschecking and editing missed out entries. The app uses Google Cloud OCR API for recognizing texts from the bill. It uses high quality image processing techniques completely recognize and process the exact texts in a bill format. Bills are well structures using CSS with replicating styles of an original bill.

Blitter comes handy with the OCR feature where it doesn’t miss out even one item in a list. It gives the exact product count with the date of the bill. We can edit the bill by adding some more entries or can include the tip percentage offered in restaurants which is usually not printed on the bill. After splitting the bill, we can directly share it as an image file using variety of options to our friends.  This app lets us allocate each item to a concerned person, which makes complex mathematical calculations simple at the end of the day. It is very quick with smaller bills, but it takes a lot of time to process larger bills with more than 20 items. It doesn’t offer us a tax calculation field.

Some of the improvements that I would recommend for this app is to support more languages. Longer bills can be split into 2 or more images and can be converted into a single output bill. Item-specific tax calculation can be included, and the final split-up can be settled to other users by integrating with any online payment methods. User accounts can be provided and can be notified for each entry made or an accountable share on the bill.
